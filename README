SmartGWT PHP Server

Simple SmartGWT PHP server which can handle simple CRUD requests.
Each datasource implements 5 operations:
- fetch
- add
- update
- remove
- custom
I've implemented Bond_SmartGwt_DataSource_DbTable which works with Zend_Db_Table.

Please bear in mind this is not full implementation of SmartGWT server but it served my needs and it will yours maybe also ;)
If you need more info do not hesitate and contact me on matus.zeman@gmail.com.
I consider SmartGWT being a very nice GWT library and I'm happy to extend server's existing code for missing functionality if there will be some interest.

Simplest usage:
$ds = new Bond_SmartGwt_DataSource_DbTable();
$ds->setDbTable(new My_Model_DbTable_User());

$server = new Bond_SmartGwt_Server();
//$server->setLog($log);
$server->addDataSource($ds, 'UserDS');

$httpResponse = $server->handle();
$httpResponse->sendResponse();
exit;
